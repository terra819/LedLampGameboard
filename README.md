# LedGameboardLamp

A 3d printed lamp that is also a playable game board. 

Lights visible on both sides, so games can be 2 player.

The logic for the games are/will be in Mit App Inventor apps

The arduino code is simply an interpreter for the app inventor's commands to light up the grid based on x,y mapped coordinates. 

Work in progress. More to come.
